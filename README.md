# DLL Injector for a specific application

# ⚠️ this is in beta expect bugs (havent found yet)⚠️

# About
Hey! I'm devllz and I made a custom injector for a specific application that actually works and doesn't require updates at all. Due to the specific applications developing team I won't be able to post the source code but I can assure you that I don't want to ruin my reputation off the bat.

# Safety
This is a completely malware+spyware-free project! I don't want to profit from it at all, I just want to provide for any developers that are having trouble finding an alternative.
Another point is that you should use an alt account when using the injector IN CASE, better safe than sorry!
With all due respect I don't consider putting malware on your device, the reason the source code isn't public (YET) is because of the risk of developers of the application patching the method.
I do not take responsibility for any illegal/unsafe usage of the program, neither do I take responsability for what you are injecting! Check before you inject.

# Usage

### Open the specific application

### Open a command prompt as administrator
